									<p>Number of projects : 2</p>

									<p>Period : 24 hours 12 hours each project</p>
									
									<p>Students will build two Basic robotic mechanisms which apply self-maintained algorithm including all theories covered through the workshop.
Projects vary from workshop to another based on the age level.
Projects are being updated every three months to cope with the latest technologies and use latest facilities.

									</p>
									<p>By the end they will get an overview about advanced technologies and ways to reach them, which makes students open minded and enhance their imagination to innovate ideas and build their own projects, for example they learn to make toys alone at home.</p>

									<p>Number of projects : 3</p>
									
									<p>Period : 36 hours 12 hours each project</p>
									
									<p>The students build three Intermediate robotic mechanisms applying autonomies algorithm while applying all theories covered through the workshops in addition to low level of artificial intelligence application.
Projects vary from one workshop to the other based on age level.
Projects are being updated every three months to cope with the latest technologies and use latest facilities.

									</p>
									<p>By the end they will realize how to choose between different control technics based on project application 
overview and ways to reach them which make students open minded and enhance their imagination to innovate new ideas and build their own projects independently.

									<p>Number of projects : 6</p>
									
									<p>Period : 120-hour 20 hour each project</p>
									
									<p>The students build six Complex robotic mechanisms applying Machine Learning algorithm while applying all theories covered through the workshops in addition to higher level of artificial intelligence application.
Projects vary from one workshop to the other based on age level.
Projects are being updated every three months to cope with the latest technologies and use latest facilities.

									</p>
									<p>By the end they will realize how to choose between different control technics and merge them with machine learning methods based on project application. 
Overview about advanced Ai systems and ways to reach them which make students open minded and enhance their imagination to innovate new ideas and build their own projects independently.

									<h1>Robone Extension</h1>
									<!-- <span>FEBRUARY 3, 2023</span> -->
									<!-- <a href="Courses.html" class="more">Read More</a> -->
									<p>Number of projects : 3</p>
									
									<p>Period : 36-hour 12 hour each project</p>
									
									<p>Students must repeat at least 1 project from each workshop they already covered by using more sophisticated methods according to their age.
									</p>
									<p>This workshop is specially designed for students who carry on from younger ages to elder ages to get them through conversion from simplified methods to normal methods which make them be capable to innovate and work on more advanced projects and applications.

									<p>Period : Quarterly renewal subscription</p>
									
									<p>
Final project is pre-selected by student replacement test to put each student in the most efficient place to be able to innovate and develop
Switching between projects is available if the student spends at least 36 hours on previous project or finished one full stage of it before switching
Nowadays Running projects for student selection major fields are:<br>
•	CNC machining and industrial robots <br>
•	Home Automation and daily use robots<br>
•	Educational platforms and kits including Mobile Apps and voice recognition techniques for breaking language barriers for students around world<br>
•	Innovative and prototyping for MSc and PhD students<br>
•	Renewable energy solutions
