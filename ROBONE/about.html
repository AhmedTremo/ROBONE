					<h2>ABOUT US</h2>
					<!-- <h2>We Have Free Templates for Everyone</h2> -->
					<p>Robone started its journey in October-2014, began at first as a public workshop to facilitate teaching the foundations of modern science, electronics, machinery and robotics in a practical and funny way. <br>

						The vision was to promote our society, beginning from childhood, with our specialized interactive workshops. Therefore, Robone decided to provide different workshops in some centers and schools and this was the first step in our journey.  In September-2015, Robone was established as an official Ltd. Company in Egypt. 
						
						Now Robone is expanding its roots through different fields, such as manufacturing in Egypt, production, and Engineering Solutions. <br>
						
						Robone introduces engineering solutions to support undergraduates, master’s Degree students and PHD to transfer their innovative ideas into reality. Robone also helps individuals and Companies to manufacture their products and even sell them as well as to help them initiate their own businesses.<br>
						
						Apart from Robone’s teaching plans and engineering solutions, Robone works on developing some high technological machines used in industries nowadays. The company has already produced 3D printers and Laser-cutting machines; Robone plans to produce an Egyptian non-conventional machine with relatively lower costs.<br>
						
						Robone has its own pre-order store selling most types of electronics. The company even makes customized printed circuit boards to satisfy customer’s needs.<br>
						
						Events and Competitions are one of the many features in Robone. We organized and participated in many competitions to motivate students to be creative and grow their teamwork skills as they compete with each other; Robone also hosts and organizes other events to support fund and introduce new technological trends to the community.
